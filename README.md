# CPE487 Final Project: Traffic Light Simulation
## Group 4- Shady Kamel, Anthony Guadagno, Matthew Vaughan
* Our project consists of a traffic light simulation game using our FPGA's VGA output. The game will be controlled by the same potentiometer and Pmod AD1 used in lab 6. 
* The goal of the game is to have the car make it to the end of a road, but the game will end if the car runs the red light. When the car reaches the intersection, a timer will trigger that will eventually change the light from green to red. The car is then free to drive to the end of the road and "win" the game. 
* Our codebase is built upon pieces of labs 3 and 6 respectively, as we were able to use some of the VGA and movement components from each lab. 
### The game in action:

### 1. Car Model and Movement


* The car is generated in car.vhd, where the wheels and body of the car are drawn separately. The left wheel and right wheel are drawn with the same algorithm, but are placed 50 pixels apart. The rest of the car is drawn in cdraw, which creates 2 rectangles to form the body of the car.
* The car moves based speed set by the controller, where the velocity of the car gets incrementally faster by turning the knob up. The car is only able to slow down via the break button on the FPGA, which slowly decrements the car speed until it comes to a full stop. 
### 2. Traffic Light Model and Counter
* When the car reaches the intersection, a timer is triggered which will count down the traffic light changing from red to green.
* Once the timer is completed and the light changes to green, the car will be able to pass the intersection.
* The remaining time will be displayed on the FPGA's built in display using the leddec function.
### 3. Loss Conditions
* If the player fails the game, the car will be reset at the starting position at zero velocity. 
* The car also resets to the beginning at zero velocity when the player wins the game.

### How to Duplicate The Project:
1. Create a new RTL project ***traffic*** in Vivado Quick Start
    * Create [] new source files of file type VHDL called []
      - clk_wiz_0.vhd, vga_sync.vhd, adc_if.vhd, and clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz.vhd are the same files as in Lab 6
    * Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called traffic
    * Choose Nexys A7-100T board for the project
    * Click 'Finish'
    * Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from []
    * Click constraints and copy the code from traffic.xdc
   
3. Run Synthesis
4. Run Implementation
5. Generate Bitstream
6. Open Hardware Manager & Program Device
   * Connect the potentiometer controller to the AD1 and connect both to the board using the top pins of the Pmod port JA (Section 10 of the Reference Manual linked above)
   * Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'
   * Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download traffic.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board
   * Turn the knob to start the game and increase the car's speed. Good Luck!

### Summary of the process:
##### 1. Began the project by setting up the base of the code, which was largely made by reworking components from labs 3 and 6 for our game, such as the car model, road and basic movement.
##### 2. Began to create the car speed method, which was slowly increased based on the input from the controller.
##### 3. Created the stoplight model and set the colors accordingly.
##### 4. Created clock and implemented it with light 
##### 5. Finalized win and loss conditions
##### 6. Set up timer to display on FPGA screen via leddec

### Timeline of the Project:
* We planned out our project outline and general approach to our ideas over the course of the last week of classes. We knew with our limited time during finals we needed a strong approach to streamline our workflow when we actually began coding after taking our CPE487 final exam. 
* Due to our planning and ideas we has before coding, most of our coding was able to be achieved over the course of 2 days. Our first day mostly consisted of indivudal work, but our 2nd day consisted of a long zoom call with all team members present to get everything finalized and working for the presentation and final submission. 

### Challenges and Solutions:
* Reformatting color in car.vhd: 
* "Multiple drivers" errors: In VHDL, signals are meant to be driven by a single source at any given time to avoid conflicts and ensure proper simulation and synthesis behavior. However, we initially wrote some parts of the code with multiple sources for the same signal, such as the car's velocity or boolean variables that would trigger things such as game over or timer. We were forced to reformat large chunks of the code using if statements to avoid signal conflicts.
